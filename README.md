Chef Claude is a recipe recommendation app that utilises the Claude API to generate a recipe from a list of ingredients provided by the user.

Simply input at least 4 ingredients and click the "Get a Recipe" button to generate your recipe!

This app was built based on the [Learn React](https://scrimba.com/learn-react-c0e) course by Bob Ziroll.
